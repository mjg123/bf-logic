A solution to a logic puzzle from the New Scientist which was placed on the BrisFunctional mailing list.

## Problem statement

Clever logic should enable you to find the nine-figure number that I have 
in mind. It consists of the digits 1 to 9 in some order, and in the number 
each digit is next to another that differs from it by one.

In just one case a digit has both neighbours differing from it by one. 
Furthermore, the solution is exactly divisible by more than three-quarters 
of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.

What is the nine-figure number?
